AlmaBetter capstone machine learning final assignment "Retail Sales Prediction"

Rossmann, a prominent retail chain with over 3,000 stores across 7 European countries, faces the challenge of accurately predicting daily sales up to six weeks in advance. This prediction is crucial for effective resource allocation, inventory management, and overall business planning. However, predicting sales accurately is complex due to various influencing factors such as promotions, competition, holidays, seasonality, and locality.

Currently, store managers individually forecast sales based on their unique circumstances, resulting in varied accuracy of predictions. To address this issue, historical sales data for 1,115 Rossmann stores is provided, offering a valuable opportunity to develop robust forecasting models.

The primary objective of this project is to leverage machine learning techniques to forecast the "Sales" column for the test set accurately. This involves analyzing historical sales data and identifying key factors influencing sales trends. Additionally, the challenge includes accounting for temporary closures of some stores for refurbishment, which may impact the overall sales dynamics.

By building accurate sales forecasting models, Rossmann aims to optimize operations, enhance decision-making processes, and improve overall business performance. This project represents a significant opportunity to harness data-driven insights to drive strategic growth and efficiency within the retail chain.
